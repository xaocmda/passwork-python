# Passwork Client

A Python client for interacting with the Passwork password management API. It provides secure password storage, retrieval, and management with client-side encryption support.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from Bitbucket:

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com:passwork-me/passwork-python.git
```

Or using HTTPS:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/passwork-me/passwork-python.git
```

## Features

- Client-side encryption with master password support
- Automatic token refresh
- Encrypted session storage and restoration
- Multi-level encryption (PBKDF2, RSA, AES)
- Attachment handling
- User and role management
- Vault management
- Password sharing via inbox
- Custom fields support
- Tagging system
- Command-line interface (CLI) for password retrieval and direct API access
- Docker container for CI/CD pipelines

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The package includes a powerful CLI that allows you to:

```bash
# Retrieve a password and use it in a command
passwork-cli exec --password-id "db_password_id" mysql -u admin -h localhost -p$DB_PASSWORD database_name

# Search for passwords by tags and use them in a script
passwork-cli exec --tags "production,database" ./deploy.sh

# Make direct API calls
passwork-cli api --method GET --endpoint "v1/vaults"

# Refresh an expired token
passwork-cli api --refresh-token "your_refresh_token" --method POST --endpoint "v1/auth/refresh-token"
```

For detailed CLI documentation and examples, see the [CLI README](cli/README.md) and the [examples directory](examples_cli/).

## Docker Support

For CI/CD pipelines and containerized environments, a Docker image is provided:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
cd docker
docker build -t passwork-cli .

# Run a command using the container
docker run -it --rm \
  -e PASSWORK_HOST="https://your-passwork.com" \
  -e PASSWORK_TOKEN="your_token" \
  -e PASSWORK_MASTER_KEY="your_master_key" \
  passwork-cli exec --password-id "db_password_id" ./deploy.sh
```

### Using in Bitbucket Pipelines

```yaml
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Deploy with Passwork credentials
        image: passwork-cli
        script:
          - passwork-cli exec --password-id "deploy_credentials" ./deploy.sh
```

For more Docker examples and configuration options, see the [Docker README](docker/README.md).

## Basic Usage

```python
from passwork_client import PassworkClient

# Initialize the client
client = PassworkClient(host="https://your-passwork-instance.com")

# Login with a token
client.set_tokens("access-token")

# Set master password for encryption/decryption
client.set_master_password("your-master-password")

# Create a vault
vault_id = client.create_vault("My Vault")

# Create a password
password_data = {
    "vaultId": vault_id,
    "title": "My Password",
    "login": "username",
    "password": "secure-password",
    "url": "https://example.com"
}
password_id = client.create_password(password_data)

# Get a password
password = client.get_password(password_id)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Session Management

Save and restore sessions to avoid repeated authentication:

```python
# Save session to file (encrypted)
encryption_key = client.save_session("session.file", None, True)

# Later, load the session
client = PassworkClient("https://your-passwork-instance.com", True)
client.load_session("session.file", encryption_key)
```

### Password Management

Create passwords with custom fields, tags, and attachments:

```python
password = {
    "name": "Service Name",
    "login": "username",
    "password": "secure-password",
    "vaultId": vault_id,
    "folderId": folder_id,  # Optional
    "description": "Description text",
    "url": "https://service-url.com",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "customs": [
        {
            "name": "Additional login",
            "value": "second-username",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "name": "Recovery code",
            "value": "recovery-code-value",
            "type": "password"
        },
        {
            "name": "TOTP",
            "value": "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP",
            "type": "totp"
        }
    ],
    "attachments": [
        {
            "path": "path/to/file.png",
            "name": "file.png"
        }
    ]
}

password_id = client.create_password(password)
```

Update an existing password:

```python
update_data = {
    "login": "new-username",
    "password": "new-password",
    "vaultId": vault_id
}
client.update_password(password_id, update_data)
```

Delete a password:

```python
bin_item_id = client.delete_password(password_id)
```

### User Management

Create a new user:

```python
# Get available user roles
user_roles = client.get_user_roles({"includeUserRole": True, "isOnlyManageable": True})
user_role = [role for role in user_roles["items"] if role["code"] == "user"][0]

# Create user
user_data = {
    "login": "new_user",
    "userRoleId": user_role["id"],
    "userGroupIds": []
}
new_user = client.create_user(user_data)
# Returns user_id, password, and master_password
```

### Password Sharing

Share a password with another user via inbox:

```python
# Recipient can access the shared password
inbox_password = client.get_inbox_password(inbox_id)
```

### Direct API Calls

For operations not covered by helper methods:

```python
# Make a direct API call
response = client.call("DELETE", f"/api/v1/folders/{folder_id}")
```
